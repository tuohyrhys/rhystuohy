# CAD + Manufacturing / Additive (DFM, Tolerances, Iteration)

This page summarizes my CAD and manufacturing work, especially around additive manufacturing and design-for-manufacturing thinking.

## CAD & manufacturing experience

### 1) Contract-style CAD / additive manufacturing work (Morin 3D context)
- Created CAD models for real parts with fit/interface constraints.
- Designed for manufacturability (print orientation, strength direction, support strategy).
- Targeted tight interface tolerances (e.g., ±0.10–0.25 mm range depending on part and process).
- Built internal templates and workflows to speed up iteration:
  - revision templates
  - cost/time estimating logic (rough internal tool)
  - a “process database” mindset to reduce rework

**One metric I’ve used previously (as stated in my resume):**
- Achieved ~16% material reduction on a load-bearing part while improving stiffness/durability through feature redistribution + print-orientation-aware design.

**Skills:** CAD, DFM, tolerance thinking, iteration speed, communication with a client/operator

### 2) How I approach CAD work (what I optimize for)
- Fit first: interfaces and clearances matter more than “pretty geometry”
- Strength with process reality: prints have anisotropy; orientation changes outcomes
- Fewer iterations: document decisions so the next version is faster
- Communicate clearly: screenshots, dimensions, notes, versioning

## What I’m adding next
- 2–3 anonymized “case study” pages:
  - problem statement
  - constraints
  - key design decisions
  - test/fit validation
  - lessons learned
- More visuals (screenshots + photos where possible)
