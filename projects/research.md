# Research Writing + Evaluation (AP Research / E-Waste Project)

I’ve also done structured research work that connects engineering, policy, and measurement. This matters to me because good engineering decisions depend on how you define and evaluate success.

## Project: E-Waste Management in Victoria, BC School Institutions
This project evaluated the effectiveness of e-waste management in school contexts, focusing on how well systems divert e-waste from landfill/incineration and what policies/awareness structures shape outcomes.

### What I did (high level)
- Designed and ran a mixed-method evaluation approach (survey + document analysis + metrics).
- Collected administrator survey responses (small sample) to understand policy and practice.
- Analyzed local waste context and linked findings to realistic action recommendations.

### What I learned
- How to define metrics that match real operational goals (diversion, participation, tracking).
- How to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders.
- How to handle limitations responsibly (small sample size, reporting constraints).

**Skills:** research design, analysis, stakeholder communication, structured writing

## What I’m adding next
- A short 1–2 page “executive summary” version
- Selected figures/tables
- A link to the final paper or slides
