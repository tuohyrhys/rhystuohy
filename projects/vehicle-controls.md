# Vehicle Controls + Dynamics (Go-Kart / Vehicle Systems)

I’m interested in vehicle engineering (including motorsports, karting, and eventually Formula-style systems). This page summarizes my work + learning in vehicle control ideas and how I approach building/test engineering projects.

> Some work is still being consolidated into publishable form (code + diagrams). I’m building out clean documentation here first so people can understand what I did.

## What I’ve worked on

### 1) Vehicle control concepts (simulation + embedded direction)
- Explored basic control ideas that translate to real systems:
  - actuator limits
  - control loop timing
  - sensor noise / sampling constraints
  - tuning and stability intuition
- Focused on practical implementation pathways, not only theory.

**Skills:** controls intuition, embedded direction, system constraints

### 2) Mechatronics & integration mindset
I like projects where you need to make tradeoffs across:
- mechanics (mounting, stiffness, tolerances)
- electronics (power, wiring, noise)
- software (loop timing, state handling)
- testing (repeatability + measurement)

That’s the same mindset used in vehicle test and development environments.

## What I’m adding next
- A short “vehicle control experiment” repo (plots, configs, results)
- A hardware integration example: mounting, wiring plan, component selection rationale
- A clean write-up of one complete loop: goal → model → control idea → test → revise
