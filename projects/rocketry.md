# Rocketry Systems (Design, Simulation, Controls, Test)

This page summarizes my rocketry-related engineering work. I’ve built and tested multiple rockets and have explored guidance/control ideas (simulation-driven) to learn real systems engineering: requirements, tradeoffs, testing, and iteration.

> Note: Some code/logs were developed across different machines and versions. I’m currently reconstructing clean, publishable repos and will link them here as they’re ready.

## What I built / explored

### 1) Flight vehicle builds (multiple rockets)
- Designed and built rockets across multiple sizes and motor classes (A–E range), including a larger ~2 m vehicle.
- Worked through airframe design decisions, stability considerations, recovery, and manufacturing constraints.
- Iterated designs based on build outcomes and flight behavior.

**Skills:** mechanical design, fabrication, iteration, flight readiness, systems thinking

---

### 2) Instrumentation + data logging (flight-ish / testing)
- Integrated sensors and data logging workflows (microcontroller + onboard logging).
- Focused on learning how to structure time-series data and interpret results (noise, sampling, calibration).
- Targeted high-rate logging (e.g., ~1 ms sampling goals in some tests).

**Skills:** embedded systems, sensor integration, data handling, validation mindset

---

### 3) Guidance/control concepts (simulation-driven)
- Explored simulation-to-implementation style workflows for trajectory guidance.
- Investigated fin-actuation control concepts and waypoint-style guidance under constraints.
- Ran tuning experiments (feed-forward concepts + basic PID prototypes) and compared behaviors.

**One metric I’ve used previously (as stated in my resume):**
- Mean closest-approach error around ~5.7 m across 10 randomized waypoint targets (50–200 m XYZ).  
  *(I’m rebuilding the documentation trail + plots that go with this so it’s easy to verify.)*

**Skills:** controls thinking, modeling, tuning, verification approaches

---

## How I think about testing (engineering approach)
Even for hobby projects, I try to follow:
- define what “success” means before testing
- log what matters (time, configuration, environmental assumptions)
- test small first, then scale
- keep notes on failures and iteration decisions

---

## What I’m adding next
- Photos + build notes for specific vehicles
- A clean “simulation / tuning” repo with plots + configs
- A short write-up of a complete workflow: requirement → design → test → revise
