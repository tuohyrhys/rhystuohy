# Rhys Tuohy — Engineering Portfolio

Hi! I’m Rhys Tuohy — an incoming Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto. I build engineering systems that mix hardware + software: rocketry guidance/control concepts, vehicle control ideas, CAD/manufacturing work, and hands-on projects focused on real, physical outcomes.

This repo is my living portfolio. It’s not “perfect” yet — I’m actively adding documentation, photos, and code as I clean things up and make them publishable.

## What I’m aiming for
I’m looking for junior/intern roles (especially over summers and during my PEY/Co-op, but I am open to part-time work over duration of studying at UofT) in:
- aerospace / space systems
- controls & mechatronics
- mechanical design / test engineering / systems engineering
- vehicle and robotics engineering
- applied research with real hardware
